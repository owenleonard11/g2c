					Artificial intelligence begins with what 
					<Citation {bib} citekey="Labban2014">
						Marzen Labban (2014)
					</Citation>
					calls the "planetary extractive machine": the globe-spanning collection of 
					mining, smelting, and refining operations that provide the raw materials for
					the manufacture of chips, boards, batteries, and other components. Despite
					abstract, ethereal imagery of "cloud architectures" and "wireless comm&shy;unications,"

						Hogan and Lepage-Richer
					</Citation>
					remind us that AI "is ultimately a resource-heavy technology reliant on
					large-scale computing infra&shy;structures."

					Increasing demand for the latest products and ever-shorter obsolescence cycles 
					have driven the extractive machine into overdriveâ€”"From the perspective of deep time,"
					<Citation {bib} citekey="Crawford2021">
						Kate Crawford (2021)
					</Citation> 
					writes, "we are extracting Earth's geological history to serve a split-second of 
					contemporary technological time."
				</SummaryParagraph>
				<SummaryParagraph>
					The AI industry drives mineral extraction primarily through its reliance on 
					specialized computer chips like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),
					Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FGPAs), and Application-Specific Integrated
					Circuits (ASICs), which rely in turn on semiconductor chips made from
					a wide array of metals and other elements. A
					<Citation {bib} citekey="Khan et al.2021">
						2021 report on the semiconductor supply chain
					</Citation>
					shows that while the United States and Western Europe dominate
					semiconductor device design, the actual extraction of the necessary
					raw materials (and therefore the environmental and health impacts of mining)
					are heavily concentrated in China and the Global South. From coltan in the 
					Congo to rare earth elements in Inner Mongolia, the exhibits on the right
					represent only a few of the many sites at which this disparity is realized.
